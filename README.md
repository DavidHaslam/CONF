# CONF
**User Defined Language** file to be used with **Notepad++** for syntax highlighting SWORD module **CONF** text files

The requirements for SWORD module configuration files are defined in the **SWORD developers' wiki**.

https://crosswire.org/wiki - follow the menu under **Development Tools**.

CONF is not a tightly defined language _per se_, so the highlighting usually has some peculiar side effects.

Even so, I have found it useful for detecting real errors in conf files for various modules.

CONF.xml should only be edited using the **Define Language GUI** in Notepad++

For **Notepad++** https://notepad-plus-plus.org/ - the popular Unicode text editor

For technical background http://docs.notepad-plus-plus.org/index.php?title=User_Defined_Language_Files
